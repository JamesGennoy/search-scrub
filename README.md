[Search Scrub](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search-scrub/)
============================================================================

Search Scrub is a Firefox add-on that clears the contents of the search box after a search.

## NO LONGER SUPPORTED
At this time, the WebExtension API that is required begining with Firefox 57, does not offer access to the search field. So I am unable to update this extension to support Firefox 57 and above.
